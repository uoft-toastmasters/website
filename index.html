            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>
                UofT Toastmasters is a public speaking and leadership development club.
                We cultivate a supportive environment where both beginners and experienced speakers can thrive.
                Founded in 2004 as an engineering student club,
                UofT Toastmasters has since expanded to include both students and professionals.
                Over the years, we've helped hundreds of students grow into incredible speakers and live
                as strong leaders. We want to help you realize your full potential as well!
                Associated with Toastmasters International,
                we invite everyone to join us at our regular meetings as guests or members.

                Hey everyone, I'm Aayush. I'm a third-year computer science major who joined Toastmasters last fall to improve my own public speaking skills, and help others do the same. In my free time, I love being active in many different ways: weightlifting, biking, soccer and skiing are some of my favourites!
